Numismatic
==========

The coin database

  At first this is going to be a desktop application. It will be a database of coins and it will help the numismatists to manage their collections better. Basically it will be a virtual copy of the owner's collection of real coins. 
  After a numismatist grows his collection very much, it becomes hard for him to find if he has a specific coin or to find the number of coins from a given year. It will be the purpose of the application- to give the owner that kind of information. This way he can easily see for example the whole size of his collection or the number of coins from a certain country.
  Other feature of the system is the opportunity to upload a picture of a coin. The program will be able to find the coin in the picture, cut it, move it to the center of the image and give it an appropriate background. It will be necessary for the original photo to have homogeneous background contrasting to the color of the coin.

Until the second milestone, I will try to implement the necessary classes and try to make it possible to push some instances of the class coin in a database and to be able to accomplish queries from the database.
